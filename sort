Dear Soumitra,

Thank you for your email and for acknowledging the genuine nature of my concerns. I appreciate your confirmation that the team will do everything possible to accommodate the financial loss resulting from the early closure of my assignment.

I would also like to note that I have consistently gone above and beyond in my role, including contributing after hours to support both the team and the companyâ€™s success. Given this commitment, I was disappointed to feel pressured during our recent call while trying to discuss a solution to a situation that arose entirely from business decisions beyond my control. I trust that going forward, discussions will remain aligned with the employee-centric approach outlined in your message.

I will share the exact amount related to the lease breakage once I hear back from the landlord. I trust this will be processed promptly as agreed.

Regards,
Prashath Karunasiri
