Subject: Re: Release Note from LeasePlan – Prashath Manorathna – 52078573

Dear Chamara,

Thank you for your response and for clarifying the process.

As mentioned earlier, my tenancy agreement—valid until 14 March 2026 with a two-month break clause—was based on the original project assignment timeline available in RAS (until 30 June 2026). I have already submitted this tenancy agreement under the Bespoke Accommodation section in the Global Claims System, and it has been approved.

Since I’m now being asked to raise a TMS with only one month’s notice, I would greatly appreciate further clarification on:
	•	Whether HCL will provide support or reimbursement for any penalty or financial loss incurred due to this sudden change, as the agreement was made in alignment with HCL-provided timelines.
	•	The next steps I should follow to escalate or formally request this support, if applicable.

I’d be grateful for any guidance or assistance in resolving this matter smoothly.

Best regards,
Prashath Karunasiri
