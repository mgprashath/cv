Subject: Re: Change in Assignment – Request for Clarification and Next Steps

Dear [Manager’s Name / Sachintha],

I acknowledge the communication requesting me to raise the TMS and TAS requests and share the Fitment ID to proceed further.

However, I would like to respectfully highlight that there is still a lack of clarity regarding my current assignment status, and I am being placed on the bench with effect from 16 May 2025. Before initiating the TMS and TAS processes, I kindly request clarification on the following points, which are critical for my housing commitments and assignment alignment:
	1.	Tenancy Agreement
I entered into a fixed-term tenancy agreement, valid until 14 March 2026, based on the original assignment timeline provided by HCL. This agreement includes a 2-month break clause and has already been submitted and approved in the Bespoke Accommodation section of the Global Claims System. The agreement was made in good faith and in direct alignment with my project assignation details.
	2.	Project Assignation Period
As per RAS, both of my current project assignations are active from 01 Jan 2025 to 30 Jun 2026. This assignment period directly influenced the terms of my housing contract. The recent notice of benching appears to conflict with this timeline, and I seek clarification on how this change will be reflected in my assignment records and what support will be provided in light of existing obligations.

In light of the above, I request that necessary clarifications and support be provided prior to initiating any TMS or TAS-related steps. Proceeding without resolution on these matters would be premature and may further complicate my situation.

I look forward to your prompt response and necessary guidance so I can proceed appropriately.

Kind regards,
Prashath Karunasiri
Employee Code: 52078573
