Sure! Here’s a clear and polite version of your Teams message to send to the HR Head:

Hello Sir,

I’m Prashath from the UK LeasePlan project. I travelled to the UK last year in February and have been working onsite since then. I’ve now been asked to raise a TMS for May 16th with only one month’s notice.

However, based on my assignment timeline (active until June 2026), I entered into a fixed-term tenancy agreement with a two-month break clause. Being asked to leave within a month is putting me in a difficult position and may lead to financial loss.

Could you please look into this and help me with a solution?

Thank you in advance.

Let me know if you’d like to make it more formal or add specific names.
