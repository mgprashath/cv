Dear [Boss’s Name],

As per our call, I’m glad to have finally received a resolution regarding the financial impact of vacating the property earlier than planned. I appreciate your agreement to cover the excess amount I will be required to bear due to the shortened notice.

I will follow up with the exact amount after receiving the final details from the landlord.

Regards,
Prashath Karunasiri
