Subject: Request for Support – Sudden Assignment Change and Tenancy Impact (Emp Code: 52078573)

Dear [Manager’s Name],

I was recently informed that I need to raise a TMS for May 16th. However, it appears this change was known prior to being communicated to me, and I was not given sufficient notice to prepare.

Based on the timeline initially provided by HCL, I entered into a fixed-term tenancy agreement valid until March 2026, with a two-month break clause. This sudden reassignment puts me at risk of financial loss due to early termination or continued rent payments.

I kindly request your support or guidance on how this can be resolved fairly, considering the commitments I made in good faith based on the company’s original timeline.

Best regards,
Prashath Karunasiri
Emp Code: 52078573
