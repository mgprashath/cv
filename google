Dear Sachintha,

Apologies for missing the scheduled call. I was in the middle of an important discussion with my landlord and letting agent, explaining my situation and requesting an exception to the two-month notice period. I had to take this step because, unfortunately, a fair resolution still does not appear to be in sight from the company’s end, despite my continuous follow-ups.

As mentioned earlier, the ongoing pressure to raise a TMS request without addressing the core concerns — especially the financial loss I’m being forced to bear — has been extremely disheartening. I’ve always given my full commitment to the project, including after-hours support, and I expected the same level of responsibility and fairness in return.

Since Sanjay has already agreed to cover the penalty, I do not see the need for another meeting at this point. I am currently awaiting the final response from the letting agent and will share the exact amount once received.

I hope this matter can now be resolved promptly and without further pressure.

Best regards,
Prashath Karunasiri
