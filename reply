Dear Soumitra,

Thank you for your response.

I would like to clarify that I came to the UK on HCL’s request—not directly under LeasePlan’s instruction. While I fully understand the situation and have no objection to working under Plan B, my concern is with the manner in which this transition is being handled.

The possibility of having to move to Plan B was known to the company well in advance. Despite this, I was not informed in a timely manner and continued making long-term arrangements in good faith, including securing a tenancy agreement based on the expected assignment duration.

Had I been informed even 25 days earlier, this entire situation could have been avoided. I would have been able to serve the required two-month notice period under my lease and manage my relocation without incurring unnecessary costs.

At this point, I am requesting one of the following:
	1.	An extension of at least 25 days on the current assignment,
or
	2.	Compensation to cover the financial impact caused by this abrupt and short-notice termination.

This all unfolded despite my housing contract being officially submitted through the Bespoke Declaration portal. When employees are required to give three months’ notice to resign, I don’t believe it is fair or consistent for the company to provide only a few weeks’ notice when ending an assignment that affects the employee’s visa, housing, and financial obligations.

As someone who relocated solely on the company’s instruction, I did not expect to be placed in a situation where I must personally bear the consequences of a decision made entirely at the company and client level. HCL is widely known and presented as an employee-centric organization — and I genuinely did not expect to be left in a financially vulnerable position without prior warning or support.

I respectfully urge you to review this matter seriously and ensure that a fair outcome is provided through either a short extension or reimbursement for the loss incurred.

Regards,
Prashath Karunasiri
